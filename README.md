Konstantly Working
David Chong, Ryan Li

Our project will be based in Processing. Players will be able to choose from a limited range of characters with a variety of skills and enter the game. In the game, there will be a series of rooms containing monster encounters and various puzzles that need to be solved in order to move on. There will also be various items and equipment that will help the player complete the room.
